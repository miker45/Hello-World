# Hello-World
Learning to code
Hey! I am tall, and I like hiking. I also like running, and data.
Honestly absolutly delighted to have found coding. 
Can't think of any career I would prefer over this!
This is now a branch off the main text. 
I can make changes to this code, then submit it for review.
If approved, it can be merged with the main code.
This is how a group of people collaborate on a project.
